# Bayesian Positive Source Separation for Raman Spectroscopy

This repository contains the implementation of my Honours thesis project in Data Science at the University of British Columbia. It is a Bayesian approach to non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) applied to Raman spectroscopy data. The project combines group- and basis-restricted non-negative matrix factorization (GBR-NMF) with Bayesian positive source separation (BPSS) to create a probabilistic NMF technique that incorporates prior knowledge and quantifies uncertainty in the source separation process.

## Project Overview

Raman spectroscopy provides unique "fingerprints" for chemical compounds, but observed spectra are often combinations of constituent spectra. This project uses Bayesian methods to unmix these signals, allowing for:
- Incorporation of prior knowledge about chemical components
- Quantification of uncertainty in source separation
- Probabilistic inference using JAGS for Gibbs sampling
